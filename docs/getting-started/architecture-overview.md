# Architecture Overview

## Introduction

Rivusio is designed as a modular, type-safe data processing framework that emphasizes flexibility, performance, and reliability. The architecture follows clean design principles with clear separation of concerns and strong typing throughout the system.

## Core Architecture Principles

1. **Modularity**
   - Each component is self-contained with well-defined interfaces
   - Loose coupling between components enables easy extension
   - Plugin system for custom functionality

2. **Type Safety**
   - Comprehensive type hints throughout the codebase
   - Runtime type checking for data validation
   - Pydantic integration for configuration management

3. **Processing Models**
   - Support for both synchronous and asynchronous processing
   - Flexible pipeline composition
   - Stream-based processing capabilities

## Key Components

### 1. Core Components

#### Pipes
- Base classes: `AsyncBasePipe` and `SyncBasePipe`
- Type-safe data transformation units
- Configurable through Pydantic models
- Support for both sync and async processing

#### Pipelines
- Composition of multiple pipes
- Automatic handling of sync/async transitions
- Resource management and cleanup
- Support for parallel execution

#### Streams
- Efficient data streaming abstraction
- Windowing and batching support
- Backpressure handling
- Error recovery mechanisms

### 2. Support Systems

#### Configuration Management
- Type-safe configuration using Pydantic
- Hierarchical configuration structure
- Runtime configuration validation
- Environment variable integration

#### Monitoring System
- Real-time metrics collection
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking and reporting
- Custom metric extensions

#### Plugin System
- Dynamic plugin discovery
- Type-safe plugin interfaces
- Central plugin registry
- Runtime plugin loading

## Data Flow

1. **Input Processing**
   - Data enters through Stream interfaces
   - Optional batching and windowing
   - Type validation and transformation

2. **Pipeline Processing**
   - Data flows through configured pipes
   - Automatic sync/async handling
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Resource management

3. **Output Handling**
   - Results collection and aggregation
   - Type-safe output validation
   - Delivery to configured sinks

## Error Handling

- Comprehensive error tracking
- Automatic retries with backoff
- Error recovery strategies
- Detailed error reporting

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient batch processing
- Parallel execution capabilities
- Resource pooling
- Memory management
- Backpressure handling

## Security

- Type-safe data handling
- Input validation
- Resource limits
- Plugin isolation

## Extensibility

The architecture is designed for extensibility through:

1. **Custom Pipes**
   - Implement custom transformation logic
   - Add domain-specific processing
   - Integrate with external systems
